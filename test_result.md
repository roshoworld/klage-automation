# Test Results - Court Automation Hub Financial Calculator Integration

## Testing Protocol

### Testing Agent Communication
- Always call `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend API testing
- Only test frontend with user permission
- Update this file with test results after each testing session
- Include specific test scenarios and outcomes

### User Problem Statement
The user requested complete integration of the financial calculator functionality into the Court Automation Hub core plugin, with CRUD operations for cost items at both template and case levels.

**Requirements:**
1. Complete integration (not just visibility fix)
2. CRUD of cost items at both template level and case level
3. Financial tab should appear and work in case creation/editing forms
4. Templates should be selectable and modifiable per case
5. Save modified case configurations as new templates

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

1. **Financial Calculator Plugin Structure Created**
   - Main plugin file: `court-automation-hub-financial-calculator.php` (v1.0.5)
   - Database manager with complete CRUD operations
   - Calculator engine with German VAT handling
   - Template management system with default templates
   - Admin interface for standalone template/cost item management
   - REST API for all financial operations
   - **Key**: Case financial integration class created

2. **Database Schema**
   - `cah_financial_templates`: Template storage with default/custom flags
   - `cah_cost_items`: Individual cost items with category classification
   - `cah_case_financial`: Case-specific financial data with totals

3. **Integration Points**
   - `CAH_Case_Financial_Integration` class exists and hooks into core plugin
   - AJAX handlers for template loading, calculations, and saving
   - Tab content rendering with JavaScript templates
   - Core plugin dependency checking

### üîÑ Current Status
- Plugins created but not yet tested
- Backend services running
- Frontend service needs restart
- Integration functionality ready for testing

### ‚ùå Known Issues
- Frontend service is in BACKOFF state (needs restart)
- No actual testing performed yet
- Plugin activation status unknown

## Next Steps
1. Test backend functionality using deep_testing_backend_v2
2. Verify plugin activation and database table creation
3. Test financial tab visibility in case forms
4. Test CRUD operations for templates and cost items
5. Test case-level financial data management
