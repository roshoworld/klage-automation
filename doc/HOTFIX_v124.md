# Hotfix Release v1.2.4

**Release Date**: June 2025  
**Release Type**: Critical Hotfix  
**Status**: Production Ready âœ…

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Fixed

### Problem
- **Error**: "Nachname des Schuldners ist erforderlich" during case creation
- **Root Cause**: The `create_new_case()` method was designed for manual case creation but was also being used for email-based case creation
- **Impact**: Email-based case creation was completely broken
- **Debug Info**: Form contained email fields (`emails_sender_email`, `emails_user_email`) instead of debtor fields (`debtors_last_name`, `debtors_first_name`)

### Analysis
The plugin supports two types of case creation:
1. **Manual Case Creation** - User enters debtor information manually
2. **Email-based Case Creation** - Cases created from spam email evidence

The same method was handling both scenarios but only validating for manual creation fields.

---

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Form Type Detection
```php
$has_debtor_fields = isset($_POST['debtors_first_name']) || isset($_POST['debtors_last_name']);
$has_email_fields = isset($_POST['emails_sender_email']) || isset($_POST['emails_user_email']);
```

### 2. Adaptive Data Processing
- **Manual Creation**: Uses provided debtor information
- **Email-based Creation**: Extracts debtor info from email sender
- **Fallback**: Uses "Unbekannt" for missing debtor information

### 3. Enhanced Validation Logic
- **Manual Cases**: Requires debtor last name
- **Email Cases**: Requires sender email
- **Adaptive**: Validation adapts based on form type

### 4. Email Information Integration
- **Case Notes**: Email details automatically added to case notes
- **Debtor Creation**: Sender email used as debtor identifier
- **Evidence Tracking**: Complete email information preserved

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Form Type Detection
```php
if ($has_debtor_fields) {
    // Manual case creation with debtor information
    $debtors_first_name = sanitize_text_field($_POST['debtors_first_name']);
    $debtors_last_name = sanitize_text_field($_POST['debtors_last_name']);
    // ... other debtor fields
} elseif ($has_email_fields) {
    // Email-based case creation
    $sender_email = sanitize_email($_POST['emails_sender_email']);
    $debtors_email = $sender_email;
    $debtors_last_name = $sender_email; // Use email as identifier
    // ... add email details to case notes
}
```

### Adaptive Validation
```php
// Only require debtor last name for manual creation
if (!$has_email_fields && empty($debtors_last_name)) {
    $errors[] = 'Nachname des Schuldners ist erforderlich.';
}

// For email-based creation, require sender email
if ($has_email_fields && empty($sender_email)) {
    $errors[] = 'Absender-E-Mail ist erforderlich.';
}
```

### Email Integration
```php
// Add email information to case notes
$case_notes .= "\n\n--- Email Details ---\n";
$case_notes .= "Sender: " . $sender_email . "\n";
$case_notes .= "User: " . $user_email . "\n";
$case_notes .= "Subject: " . $email_subject . "\n";
$case_notes .= "Content: " . $email_content . "\n";
```

## ðŸ“‹ What's Working Now

### Dual Case Creation Support
- âœ… **Manual Creation** - Traditional form with debtor fields
- âœ… **Email-based Creation** - From spam email evidence
- âœ… **Adaptive Validation** - Different requirements for each type
- âœ… **Smart Data Extraction** - Debtor info from email sender
- âœ… **Evidence Preservation** - Email details in case notes

### Enhanced Debug Information
- âœ… **Form Type Detection** - Shows which form type was detected
- âœ… **Field Presence** - Shows available form fields
- âœ… **Email Information** - Shows extracted email data
- âœ… **Validation Context** - Shows why validation failed

### Backward Compatibility
- âœ… **Existing Manual Forms** - Still work as before
- âœ… **CSV Import** - Unaffected by changes
- âœ… **Case Editing** - No impact on existing functionality
- âœ… **Bulk Operations** - All still functional

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Email-based Case Creation
- [ ] Submit form with email fields (sender, user, subject, content)
- [ ] Verify case is created successfully
- [ ] Check that sender email is used as debtor identifier
- [ ] Confirm email details are added to case notes
- [ ] Verify success message indicates "aus E-Mail"

### Manual Case Creation
- [ ] Submit form with debtor fields (first name, last name, etc.)
- [ ] Verify case is created successfully
- [ ] Check that debtor information is properly stored
- [ ] Confirm validation still requires debtor last name
- [ ] Verify success message is standard

### Mixed/Missing Data
- [ ] Submit form with neither debtor nor email fields
- [ ] Verify fallback to "Unbekannt" debtor
- [ ] Check that case is still created successfully
- [ ] Confirm appropriate validation messages
