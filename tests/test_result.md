Debtor fields prioritized when they contain meaningful data. Email fields only required when they are the primary source of case data. Enhanced logic checks for meaningful data first before determining validation requirements. 'Unbekannt' value validation working correctly. Either/OR validation logic properly implemented. Issue #2 RESOLVED - Form Data Persistence: Complete form data persistence implemented with get_form_data() method. All form fields retain values after validation failures using $form_data array with proper escaping (esc_attr, esc_textarea). Found 12 persistent form fields including case_id, debtor information, and email evidence fields. Users no longer lose entered data on validation errors.

    message: "🚀 HOTFIX v1.2.6 VERIFICATION COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of the final two critical issues resolved in v1.2.6. All 27 tests passed (100% success rate). Issue #1 RESOLVED - Case Creation Validation Logic: Enhanced validation logic implemented with meaningful data detection (has_meaningful_debtor_data and has_meaningful_email_data) vs simple field presence checking. Either/OR validation logic now requires either meaningful debtor OR email data (not both). Enhanced debtor name validation properly handles 'Unbekannt' values. All mixed field scenarios working correctly: debtor-only (debtor fields filled, email empty), email-only (email fields filled, debtor empty), both fields filled, and proper rejection when neither has meaningful data. Issue #2 RESOLVED - Status Change Unknown Action: Added complete GET-based action handling with handle_get_status_change() and handle_get_priority_change() methods. URL parameter handling for new_status and new_priority implemented with proper validation. GET action routing integrated into admin_page_cases switch statement. Enhanced debug information shows meaningful data detection results, validation context, POST data keys, and field lengths. Specific error messages for different validation scenarios and success feedback for changes. Improved unknown action handling with comprehensive debug information. Version updated to 1.2.6.

System now prioritizes debtor fields when they contain meaningful data and only requires email fields when they are the primary source of case data. Enhanced logic checks for meaningful data first before determining validation requirements. 'Unbekannt' value validation working correctly. Either/OR validation logic properly implemented. Issue #2 RESOLVED - Form Data Persistence: Complete form data persistence implemented with get_form_data() method preserving POST data across validation failures. All form fields retain values after validation errors using $form_data array with proper escaping (esc_attr, esc_textarea). Found 12 persistent form fields including case_id, debtor information, and email evidence fields. Users no longer lose entered data on validation errors. All test focus areas from review request verified: ✅ Case creation with meaningful debtor data + email subject works without requiring sender email ✅ Case creation with only email fields requires sender email ✅ Form data persistence works correctly on validation failures ✅ Mixed field scenarios work correctly ✅ All existing functionality preserved including GDPR amounts and database operations.
