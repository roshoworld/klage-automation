Enhanced validation logic provides different requirements for each form type (debtor last name for manual, sender email for email-based). Email integration extracts debtor info from sender email and preserves complete email details in case notes. Backward compatibility maintained for manual forms and CSV import. Enhanced debug information shows form type detection and validation context. Email-based success messages differentiated with '(aus E-Mail)' indicator. Version updated to 1.2.4. Critical email-based case creation issue resolved successfully."
