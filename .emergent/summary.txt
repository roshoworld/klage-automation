The AI engineer's work transitioned from initial core feature development and bug fixes to a comprehensive re-architecture of database management. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the  plugin by addressing recurring  failures (switching to direct SQL), headers already sent errors for CSV downloads (using  and AJAX), and numerous  errors for case CRUD operations, alongside refining complex validation logic and implementing form data persistence.

A series of persistent Unknown column database errors (, , , ) led to a pivotal strategic shift. Instead of reactive hotfixes, the engineer proposed and implemented a robust, schema-driven Database CRUD system (v1.4.0-v1.4.3). This involved creating , , , and  classes to dynamically manage database structure, forms, and CSV templates, ensuring automatic synchronization. The system was further enhanced to support unique key management (v1.4.4). The immediate challenge is resolving a syntax error in  (v1.4.5 attempt) which is currently preventing plugin activation.

<product_requirements>
The Klage.Click platform is designed as a multi-purpose legal automation system for German courts, specifically for converting legal violations into automated court proceedings, initially targeting GDPR Spam Violations under €1,500. The core is a WordPress plugin, Court Automation Hub, built with custom MySQL database tables.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Backoffice Management**: CRUD operations for documents, variables, cases, and lawyers.
*   **Email Intake**: With planned OCR and AI analysis for case categorization.
*   **Document Generation**: For legal letters and court filings.
*   **Localization**: System must be in German, with money-related display removed from direct UI.
*   **Initial Goal**: Process 60 existing spam cases.

Current implementation includes:
*   Custom database tables: , , , , , , , , now fully synchronized.
*   Admin dashboard with comprehensive case CRUD, bulk actions, and a dynamic financial calculator (auto-calculates GDPR amounts e.g., €548.11).
*   Robust  CSV import system supporting 17-field external and 57-field internal master data models with intelligent mapping.
*   Support for both manual and email-based case creation with enhanced validation.
*   Extensive audit logging.
*   A newly implemented, comprehensive Database CRUD system for managing schema, forms, and imports dynamically through the admin interface, including unique key management.

-   **Object-Oriented PHP**: Extensive use of classes (, , etc.).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a WordPress plugin named Court Automation Hub.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main plugin entry point, handles activation/deactivation, and initializes core classes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Plugin version updated iteratively from  to . The plugin now explicitly requires and initializes the new , , , and  classes. It hooks the  method to the  action to ensure automatic database schema updates on admin page load.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages custom database table creation and updates.
    -   **Changes Made**: Switched from  to direct SQL . Added/enhanced , , , , , . Critically, it was modified to include an  method that performs  operations to modify existing columns (e.g.,  from  to ) and add missing columns (,  to ; , , and many others to ) during an automatic schema upgrade process triggered on admin page load.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core of the WordPress admin interface, managing the dashboard, case listing, creation, editing, financial calculator, CSV import, and help pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: Received extensive updates for case CRUD bug fixes, bulk actions, financial calculator, and CSV import logic (supporting dual 17/57 field templates). Validation logic for case creation was refined to intelligently handle mixed debtor/email inputs. Form data persistence was implemented to retain user input on validation errors. Crucially, the integration of the new Database Management section involved fixing the parent menu slug and page parameters to correctly display the new UI under Klage.Click Hub. CSS was also updated for new UI elements.

-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Importance**: The central component of the new strategic database management system. It defines the complete expected schema for all custom tables (, , etc.), compares it with the actual database structure, and performs necessary  operations to synchronize the database.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains methods for adding, modifying, and dropping columns, as well as managing unique keys and indexes. It includes logic to refresh its internal schema cache after any CRUD operations to ensure consistency. It now dynamically reads the *actual* database structure as the source of truth for schema definitions, enabling auto-updates to forms and templates.

-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Importance**: Generates dynamic HTML forms for cases and debtors based on the 's current schema. This ensures forms automatically adapt to any changes in the database structure.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented logic to map database column types to appropriate HTML input fields (text, textarea, select, date, email, number) and auto-generate German field labels from column names. Currently, it is the source of the most recent syntax error preventing plugin activation.

-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the generation of dynamic CSV templates for import and handles the export of data, ensuring templates and exports always reflect the current database schema.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented methods to generate various CSV templates (e.g.,  and comprehensive 57-field) dynamically based on the current schema, including smart field mapping and data validation logic.

-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Importance**: Provides the administrative interface (GUI) for the comprehensive Database CRUD system. It integrates , , and  functionalities into the WordPress admin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Developed with multiple tabs for Schema Management (for DB structure CRUD), Data Management (now replaced with structure CRUD focus), Import/Export, and Form Generator. It handles user interactions for adding/modifying/dropping columns, managing unique keys/indexes, and displaying schema status. Its menu slug was corrected to appear under Klage.Click Hub.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Styles the WordPress admin interface elements for the plugin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include styles for the new Database Structure CRUD interface elements, improving readability and user experience.

-   ** Directory (New hotfix files)**:
    -   **Importance**: Provides detailed documentation for each hotfix and major release.
    -   **Changes Made**: Numerous hotfix documents ( to , , ) and comprehensive system documentation (, , ) were created, detailing the issues, fixes, and testing results for each iteration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was systematically resolving a series of database-related errors that emerged during case creation. Initially, a problem with the  field ( vs. Deutschland) was fixed by updating the schema definition and then implementing an  mechanism (, ). This led to further Unknown column errors for ,  (in ), , , etc. (in ), and .

Recognizing a recurring whack-a-mole problem with missing columns, the user requested a strategic solution. The AI engineer then pivoted to implementing a comprehensive Database CRUD system, including:
1.  ****: To define and synchronize the database schema programmatically. This class now dynamically inspects the database and automatically adds missing columns and manages unique keys/indexes.
2.  ****: To dynamically create forms based on the live schema, ensuring forms always match the database.
3.  ****: To dynamically generate CSV templates.
4.  ****: A new admin UI allowing users to manage database structure (add/modify/drop columns, unique keys) directly, eliminating manual  operations.

This new system (versions  to ) ensures that when database fields are added or modified via the new CRUD interface, forms and CSV templates automatically update without additional steps. The system also supports adding unique keys to tables.

The very last reported issue, after implementing and testing the new DB CRUD and unique key management features (), is a PHP syntax error preventing plugin activation: . The AI engineer has identified this error and is currently in the process of fixing it.
