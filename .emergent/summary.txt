The trajectory chronicles the iterative development and stabilization of the Klage.Click Court Automation Platform as a WordPress plugin. Initially, the AI engineer established core functionalities like case creation, viewing, and a financial calculator, along with a significant CSV import module for  data. A major milestone involved implementing a comprehensive 57-field master data model, initially for import and then refined to a dual-template system (17-field Forderungen.com specific and 57-field internal).

A significant portion of the work focused on resolving critical, recurring bugs:
*    failures led to a switch to direct SQL for database management.
*   Persistent headers already sent errors during CSV downloads were resolved via an  hook and AJAX.
*   A series of hotfixes (v1.2.1 to v1.2.6) addressed numerous  errors for case editing, creation, and bulk actions, along with refining complex validation logic, especially concerning manual vs. email-based case creation.
*   Folder structure cleanup and comprehensive documentation were also performed.

The work passed to me at a point where two new critical issues have been identified: an erroneous email validation requirement during case creation (when debtor data is present), and the loss of form data upon validation failure, which severely impacts user experience.

<product_requirements>
The Klage.Click platform is a multi-purpose legal automation system for German courts, converting legal violations into automated court proceedings. It targets small claims (under €1,500), initially GDPR Spam Violations. The core is a WordPress plugin, Court Automation Hub, utilizing custom database tables. Key functionalities include backoffice management (document/variable CRUD, case/lawyer management), email intake with OCR/AI analysis, and document generation. The system must be in German, with money-related display removed from direct UI. Initial goal was to process 60 existing spam cases.

Current implementation includes: plugin activation, custom database tables (, , , , , , , ), an admin dashboard with case CRUD operations (creation, viewing, editing, deletion), comprehensive bulk actions, and a dynamic financial calculator with automatic GDPR calculations (€548.11). A critical  CSV import system supports both a 17-field external template and a comprehensive 57-field internal master data model, with intelligent mapping and validation. The plugin now handles both manual and email-based case creation and has extensive audit logging.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main plugin entry point, handles activation/deactivation, and initializes core classes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Explicitly  during activation. Plugin version updated iteratively from  to . Contains the  hook for early download handling.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages custom database table creation and updates for the application's data models.
    -   **Changes Made**: Switched from  to direct SQL . Added/enhanced ,  (with comprehensive fields), and new tables: , , , . Added  and  fields to existing tables.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core of the WordPress admin interface, managing the dashboard, case listing, creation, editing, financial calculator, CSV import, and help pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file received the most significant and iterative changes.
        *   Initial fixes for  and other case CRUD methods (, , , ).
        *   Implemented  for bulk delete, status, and priority changes.
        *   Implemented  (for dynamic financial fields), , , .
        *   **CSV Import**: Refactored to support a dual template system:  (17 fields) and  (57 fields). Logic was added to  and  to map  data to the full 57-field internal structure.
        *   **Validation**: Iteratively refined case creation validation to adapt to manual vs. email-based inputs, requiring either meaningful debtor or email data. Enhanced error messages and debug info.
        *   **UI**: Redesigned  to include a complete debtor information section and reorganize layout for better user experience.
        *   **Action Handling**: Added  and  for POST requests, and corresponding GET-based handlers to fix Unknown action errors from case list links.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles CRUD operations for cases.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and extended to support comprehensive case management features, including case notes and updated dates.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages audit trail logging for all key actions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created with new  table integration.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages debtor data.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to handle  table, supporting automatic creation from CSV import (company vs. individual) and integration with case creation forms.

-   **Documentation Files (, , , etc.)**:
    -   **Importance**: Provide essential information on plugin usage, deployment, and project scope.
    -   **Changes Made**: Progressively updated throughout development to reflect new versions and clarify features. A new  directory was created to centralize documentation, and a  directory for test files. Versioning was rigorously applied across various documentation files for each release (v1.2.1-v1.2.6).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two new critical issues reported by the user regarding case creation:

1.  **Validation Logic Issue**: When creating a new GDPR Spam Case, the user reported an error Wenn E-Mail-Evidenz angegeben wird, ist die Absender-E-Mail erforderlich. (If email evidence is provided, the sender's email is required). Debug information showed that  had meaningful data (Hopp),  was true, but  was also true (likely due to  being filled), while  was empty. The current validation logic incorrectly requires  if *any* email-related field is present, even if the primary data for the case is coming from debtor fields. The system needs to intelligently prioritize debtor fields if they are meaningfully filled, or require email fields only if they are the primary source of data.

2.  **Form Data Loss**: A significant usability issue was raised: when the error appears the whole data that was already put in disappears and we need to start from scratch. Can you keep the session data? This indicates that upon validation failure, the form fields are not pre-populated with the user's previously entered data, leading to a frustrating experience.

The AI engineer has acknowledged these two issues and stated the plan to fix them, starting with the validation logic and then the data loss. This is the immediate and pending work.
