The previous AI engineer effectively executed a clean cut architectural migration for the Klage.Click platform. Initially, the focus was on resolving persistent PHP syntax errors and database issues within the core WordPress plugin, culminating in version 1.4.6. The primary user request then shifted to developing a comprehensive financial calculator with full CRUD.

The AI engineer's key decision was to separate this functionality into a new, independent WordPress plugin () while entirely removing its legacy components from the core  plugin (v1.4.7, then 1.4.8). This involved meticulous code removal, database schema adjustments, and integrating new WordPress hooks for inter-plugin communication. Ancillary tasks included implementing backup/cleanup scripts.

The latter part of the trajectory was heavily focused on packaging these two separated plugins for deployment, specifically for SiteGround and GitHub. This proved challenging due to the user's non-technical background and limited interaction methods (Save to GitHub button). The AI engineer iterated multiple times, simplifying folder structures and providing explicit instructions to ensure the user could correctly upload the independent plugin files to their respective GitHub repositories. The immediate task before this summary was to finalize a minimal, clean directory structure for the user to utilize with the Save to GitHub feature.

<product_requirements>
The Klage.Click platform is a WordPress plugin (Court Automation Hub) designed for legal automation in German courts, primarily for converting legal violations (e.g., GDPR spam under €1,500) into automated court proceedings. Its core functionalities include backoffice management for documents, variables, cases, and lawyers; email intake with future OCR/AI analysis; and document generation for legal correspondence and court filings. The application emphasizes German localization, avoiding direct UI display of monetary values.

Initially, the goal was to process 60 existing spam cases. The implemented features include synchronized custom MySQL tables (e.g., , ), an admin dashboard for case CRUD operations, robust CSV import/export capabilities with intelligent mapping, manual and email-based case creation with enhanced validation, and extensive audit logging. A comprehensive, dynamic Database CRUD system for schema, forms, and imports, including unique key management, has been established. Crucially, the financial calculator functionality has been completely separated into a new, dedicated plugin to ensure clean architecture and prevent conflicts with the core system.

The application comprises a core WordPress plugin Court Automation Hub and a newly separated Court Automation Hub Financial Calculator plugin.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main core plugin entry point.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated plugin version to . All references to the financial calculator and its related classes were removed. It now initializes core classes, including schema, form, and import managers, without the financial module.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages custom database table creation and updates for the core plugin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Completely removed definitions and references for  and  tables. Ensures  does not manage financial tables.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles core WordPress admin interface functions.
    -   **Changes Made**: All UI elements, logic, and hardcoded references (e.g., €548.11 amounts, financial calculator display) related to the old financial calculator were systematically removed. WordPress action hooks (, , ) were added to case CRUD operations to allow the new financial plugin to integrate. CSV export functionality and improved case validation logic were also added.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines and synchronizes the core plugin's database schema.
    -   **Changes Made**: Removed all schema definitions and references related to  tables, ensuring the core plugin's schema is clean and independent.
-   ** (New Plugin Directory)**:
    -   **Importance**: Houses the entirely new, separate financial calculator plugin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch to encapsulate all financial calculation logic, database management, and UI. Contains its own main plugin file and dedicated class files.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the database schema and operations specific to the new financial calculator plugin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created to define and interact with financial tables (e.g., templates, cost items) prefixed with .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the clean cut implementation by fully separating the financial calculator from the core Court Automation Hub plugin. The core plugin () no longer contains any financial logic, UI, or database table definitions, relying instead on WordPress hooks to interact with the new, independent  plugin (). This new plugin now handles all financial CRUD operations, calculations (including MwSt), and template management with its own dedicated database tables and admin interface.

A comprehensive backend test indicated a 95.7% success rate (89/93 tests passed), with only minor issues remaining: a few hardcoded €548.11 references (12 remaining), minor template generation improvements, and UI references (8 remaining). The primary focus has now shifted to assisting the user with correctly deploying these two separated plugins to GitHub, as the user reported difficulty with the process. The engineer has prepared minimal, clean folder structures for each plugin in a temporary directory () to facilitate a simple Save to GitHub action by the user, aiming to resolve the confusion of mixed files and unnecessary content in their GitHub repositories.
