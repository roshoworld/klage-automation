The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the development of the Klage.Click Court Automation Platform as a WordPress plugin. The process was highly iterative, marked by persistent debugging of core plugin functionalities, particularly related to PHP syntax errors,  failures (requiring a switch to direct SQL), and recurring headers already sent issues during file downloads. Initial efforts focused on establishing a functional base, including case creation and viewing, and fixing an  error for case editing.

Subsequent development cycles progressively enhanced the plugin: full case editing, advanced case listing with bulk actions, and an audit trail were implemented. A significant feature addition was the dynamic financial management system, coupled with a robust CSV import module specifically tailored for  data. The headers already sent error during CSV downloads proved exceptionally challenging, requiring multiple iterations of fixes, finally moving to an  hook for early processing. The trajectory concludes with the successful parsing of detailed  master data and a plan to implement an enterprise-level system in v1.2.0.

<product_requirements>
The Klage.Click platform is a comprehensive, multi-purpose legal automation system for German courts, transforming legal violations into automated court proceedings. It targets high-value small claims (under €1,500), initially focusing on GDPR Spam Violations. The core is a WordPress plugin, Court Automation Hub, using custom database tables. Key functionalities include: backoffice management (document/variable CRUD, case/lawyer management), email intake with OCR/AI analysis, and document generation. The system should be in German, with money-related display removed from direct UI. Initial goal was to process 60 existing spam cases.

Implementation progress includes: plugin activation, database table creation, admin dashboard, case creation with automatic €548.11 GDPR calculations, case viewing, and a partially working case editing feature. Subsequent requests expanded to full case editing, advanced case listing with filtering and bulk actions, status workflow (Draft, Processing, Completed), audit logging, and a dynamic financial calculator. A critical requirement emerged for a CSV import system, specifically to integrate with 's exact data model, enabling bulk case and debtor creation. The latest request confirms the integration of a comprehensive master data model (57 fields, including EGVP/XJustiz mapping) for an enterprise-level system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was finalizing the integration of the  master data model into the Court Automation Hub plugin, specifically for the CSV import functionality. This involved ensuring that the plugin's CSV template and import processing logic precisely matched the field names and structure of the user's provided  master data CSV.

The user initially provided a GitHub URL to the CSV file (Chat 305). The AI engineer attempted to fetch and analyze this file (Chat 306, 308), but initially failed due to access issues. After a retry prompt from the user (Chat 312), the AI engineer successfully accessed and analyzed the content of the master data CSV (Chat 314).

Upon analysis, the AI engineer recognized the comprehensive nature of the provided master data, noting 57 fields (21 confirmed from  and 36 proposed for complete legal automation, including EGVP/XJustiz mapping and audit trail/GDPR compliance). The user then increased the budget (Chat 315).

The current work concluded with the AI engineer acknowledging the increased budget and the detailed master data specification, planning to implement a full enterprise-level system for v1.2.0 based on this comprehensive data. This implies that the immediate task is to begin integrating the full 57-field structure into the plugin's data models and import processes.
