The trajectory details the post-MVP phase of the Klage.Click WordPress platform, focusing on architecturally separating a financial calculator from the core plugin and subsequently integrating it seamlessly. Initially, the AI engineer executed a clean cut to decouple the financial module into a new plugin (, v1.0.0-v1.0.5) from the core  (v1.4.8). This involved meticulous code removal, schema adjustments, and establishing WordPress hooks for inter-plugin communication.

A significant challenge arose during deployment, as the user's Save to GitHub workflow required precise directory preparation, leading to multiple iterations of file structuring. Post-deployment, the focus shifted to fixing various activation, class conflict, and functionality regressions (e.g., core plugin losing features, financial calculator's template/cost item CRUD not working fully). The AI engineer iteratively addressed these by enhancing class loading, renaming classes/functions for uniqueness, and implementing full CRUD for financial templates and cost items.

The latter part of the conversation concentrated on deeper integration: displaying financial data within the core case management UI. This involved fixing persistent database schema issues (e.g.,  column,  table) and adding a tabbed interface for financial configuration within case creation/editing forms. The engineer also refined the database repair mechanism to be user-friendly and preserve data, moving away from manual SQL. The trajectory ends with the core plugin at v1.5.4, having addressed numerous activation and database issues, and laying the groundwork for UI integration, though the financial tab visibility remains a pending fix.

<product_requirements>
The Klage.Click platform is a WordPress plugin (Court Automation Hub) for legal automation in German courts, automating court proceedings for legal violations (e.g., GDPR spam). Core functionalities include backoffice management for documents, variables, cases, and lawyers; email intake; and document generation. The application emphasizes German localization and avoids direct UI display of monetary values.

The project aimed to process 60 existing spam cases. Implemented features include synchronized custom MySQL tables (, ), an admin dashboard for case CRUD, robust CSV import/export, manual/email-based case creation with validation, and audit logging. A dynamic Database CRUD system with unique key management has been established.

Crucially, the financial calculator functionality was completely separated into a new, dedicated plugin (). This financial plugin (v1.0.4) now manages its own templates, calculations (including 19% MwSt), and individual cost items (Grundkosten, Gerichtskosten, Anwaltskosten, Sonstige) with full CRUD operations. The current goal is to seamlessly integrate this financial calculator into the core case management UI, allowing users to select templates, modify costs per case, and save modifications as new templates, directly within case creation and editing forms. Database table schema updates must also be handled automatically and safely.

<code_architecture>
The application consists of two main WordPress plugins: the core Court Automation Hub and the Court Automation Hub Financial Calculator.



-   ** (Core Plugin Main File)**:
    -   **Importance**: Entry point for the core plugin, responsible for loading core components and defining main plugin hooks.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated version to . All direct financial calculator logic and UI elements have been removed. It now focuses on core case management, audit logging, and data handling. Includes  checks for all instantiated classes to prevent fatal errors when multiple plugins are active. It provides WordPress  hooks (, , ) for other plugins to integrate.
-   ** (Financial Plugin Main File)**:
    -   **Importance**: Main entry point for the dedicated financial calculator plugin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated version to . Renamed main class from  to  to avoid conflicts. It now includes enhanced dependency checks for the core plugin and automatic deactivation/error notices if the core plugin is missing or conflicts are detected. It also handles custom menu integration and loading of its own dedicated classes.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages custom database table creation and updates for core tables (, , etc.).
    -   **Changes Made**: Ensured  is used for safer table updates, preserving data while adding/modifying columns. Specifically fixed the  table schema to properly include  as a non-unique, editable field, while uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) remains the primary key. Logic added to generate  for existing records.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles the core WordPress admin interface functions, including case CRUD and plugin settings.
    -   **Changes Made**: All UI elements, logic, and hardcoded references related to the *old* financial calculator were systematically removed. A tabbed interface has been added for case creation/editing, preparing for the financial tab. The Fall ID field in case editing was made editable, with client-side AJAX uniqueness validation. The database repair function was enhanced to detect and add missing columns.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides the administrative interface for the new financial calculator plugin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created/modified to include full CRUD functionality for financial templates and individual cost items. Manages the display and forms for these financial entities within its own dedicated admin pages (, ).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the database schema and operations specific to the new financial calculator plugin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created to define and interact with financial tables (, , ).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the core logic for financial calculations (e.g., MwSt, subtotals, grand totals).
    -   **Changes Made**: Renamed to  to avoid class name conflicts.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New class to manage the integration of financial data and UI within the core plugin's case management screens.
    -   **Changes Made**: Responsible for rendering the financial tab content, handling AJAX requests for template loading, cost calculation, and saving financial data linked to cases.
-   ** / **:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend JavaScript for admin functionalities and the new financial tab.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented tab switching logic, AJAX calls for case ID uniqueness validation, and prepared for real-time financial calculations and template loading within case forms.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues to ensure both the core Court Automation Hub plugin (v1.5.4) and the Court Automation Hub Financial Calculator plugin (v1.0.5) function correctly and integrate seamlessly.

The primary focus has been on resolving the Unknown column case_id in field list database error during new case creation. This was identified as a schema mismatch in the  table. The solution involved enhancing the existing Alle Tabellen erstellen/reparieren button within the core plugin's database management settings. This enhancement ensures that the  column is automatically added to the  table if missing, and that existing records are populated with generated  values, all without data loss or requiring manual SQL commands from the user.

Furthermore, the user requested that the  (Fall ID) be changeable but still unique. The engineer modified the case editing form in the core plugin () to make the Fall ID editable and implemented client-side JavaScript () with an AJAX backend check () to validate its uniqueness in real-time.

A significant part of the current work involves the UI integration of the financial calculator into the core case management. A tabbed interface was introduced into the case creation and editing forms (), with corresponding CSS () and JavaScript () to handle tab switching. However, the financial tab itself is currently not visible, which is the immediate issue being addressed.

The overall status is that core plugin activation is successful, and the core functionalities (case creation, etc., post database fix) are restored. The financial calculator plugin (v1.0.5) is activated and its standalone features (templates, cost items CRUD) are working. The missing link is the complete display and functionality of the financial tab within the core case management UI.
