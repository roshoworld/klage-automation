The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Klage.Click platform from initial core functionality and bug resolution to robust architectural enhancements. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the WordPress plugin by fixing recurring database issues, headers already sent errors, and  errors, along with refining validation and form persistence. Persistent Unknown column errors necessitated a strategic pivot to a schema-driven Database CRUD system (v1.4.0-v1.4.4), introducing , , , and  for dynamic schema, form, and CSV management.

The immediate challenge upon handover was a PHP syntax error in  (v1.4.5), which the engineer successfully debugged and resolved by relocating a misplaced configuration array. This led to updating the core plugin to v1.4.6. Subsequently, the user requested a comprehensive financial calculator with full CRUD, leading to a critical architectural decision: a clean cut migration. The existing basic financial calculator was completely removed from the core plugin (v1.4.7), and a new, separate  plugin was created with its own dedicated database management and classes. Concurrently, an automatic backup system and repository cleanup scripts were implemented to improve project maintainability, setting the stage for future modular feature development. The engineer is now poised for final comprehensive testing.

<product_requirements>
The Klage.Click platform is a WordPress plugin (Court Automation Hub) designed for legal automation in German courts, focusing on converting legal violations (initially GDPR spam under €1,500) into automated court proceedings.
Core functionalities include:
*   Backoffice management (CRUD for documents, variables, cases, lawyers).
*   Email intake with planned OCR/AI analysis.
*   Document generation for legal letters/court filings.
*   German localization; no direct UI display of money.
*   Initial goal: Process 60 existing spam cases.
Current implementation features:
*   Synchronized custom MySQL tables: , , , , , , .
*   Admin dashboard with case CRUD, bulk actions, and a financial calculator (now removed from core).
*   Robust CSV import (17/57 field templates) with intelligent mapping.
*   Manual and email-based case creation with enhanced validation.
*   Extensive audit logging.
*   A comprehensive, dynamic Database CRUD system for schema, forms, and imports, including unique key management. The financial calculator is now a separate plugin.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed a critical PHP syntax error fix in  (specifically, a stray  statement) that was preventing plugin activation. This fix was verified by passing all 23 backend tests, and the core plugin version was updated to .

Following this, the user requested a comprehensive financial calculator with full CRUD capabilities for case costs. After a discussion on architectural approaches, a clean cut strategy was adopted to avoid conflicts with the existing, unusable basic financial calculator. This involved:
1.  **Removing the old financial calculator:** All associated UI elements, hardcoded values, and database table definitions (, ) were systematically removed from the  core plugin, updating its version to .
2.  **Creating a new, separate Financial Calculator plugin:** A new plugin directory  was established. This plugin includes its own core file () and dedicated classes in its  subdirectory (, , , , ). This new plugin is designed to provide full CRUD for templates and per-case financial items, with automatic MwSt calculations and a clean API for future integrations like document generation.
3.  **Implementing auxiliary systems:** An  script was created for automatic project backups, and a  script was developed to declutter the repository by archiving old test and hotfix files.
The current state is that these changes have been implemented, and a final comprehensive test is pending to verify all functionality of the newly restructured application.
