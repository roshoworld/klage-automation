## ðŸš¨ **If You Get Stuck**

### **Common Issues:**
- **Can't find the files?** Make sure you're looking in `/app/github-repositories/`

- **GitHub looks confusing?** Just look for the green "Add file" button

### **What NOT to Do:**
- Don't upload the `/app/github-repositories/` folder itself
- Don't upload the `UPLOAD-INSTRUCTIONS.md` file
- Don't mix files from both repositories

## ðŸ“ž **Final Check**

After you upload both repositories, you should have:
- **Repository 1:** Clean WordPress plugin ready to download
- **Repository 2:** Clean financial calculator plugin ready to download
- **Both work independently** but together make a complete system

**Your users can now easily click "Download ZIP" and get working plugins!** ðŸŽ‰
